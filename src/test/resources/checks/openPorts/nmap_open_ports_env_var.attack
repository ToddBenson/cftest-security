Feature: nmap attacks
  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following environment variables:
      | name       | environment_variable_name |
      | hostname  | HOSTNAME |

   Scenario: Verify port 80 is open using the nmap fast flag
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F -open -Pn <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should match:
      """
      443\/tcp.*open.*https
      """
