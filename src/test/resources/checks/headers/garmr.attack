Feature: Run garmr scan on a URL

Scenario: Use Garmr to scan a website for the Mozilla opioniated security requirements
  Given "garmr" is installed
  And the following environment variables:
    | name     | environment_variable_name |
    | hostname | HOSTNAME   |
  When I launch a "garmr" attack with:
    """
    garmr -u https://<hostname> -o my_garmr_output.xml
    """
  Then it should pass with:
    """
    [Garmr.corechecks.Http200Check] Fail The response code was 302
    """
  And the file "my_garmr_output.xml" should contain XML:
    | css                                      |
    | testcase[name="Http200Check"] failure    |
  And the file "my_garmr_output.xml" should not contain XML:
    | css                                      |
    | testcase[name="SCSPHeaderCheck"] failure |
