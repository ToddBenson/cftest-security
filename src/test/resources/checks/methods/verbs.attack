Feature: Evaluate responses to various HTTP methods.

Background:
  Given "curl" is installed
  And the following environment variables:
    | name     | environment_variable_name |
    | hostname | HOSTNAME |

Scenario Outline: Verify server responds correctly to various HTTP methods
  When I launch a "curl" attack with:
    """
    curl -i -X <method> <hostname>
    """
  Then the output should contain "<response>"
  Examples:
    | method | response                       |
    | delete | 302 | 
    | patch  | 302 |
    | trace  | 302 |
    | track  | 302 |
    | bogus  | 302 |
