Background:
  Given "curl" is installed
  And the following environment variables:
    | name     | environment_variable_name |
    | hostname | HOSTNAME |

Scenario: Check for SSL vulnerabilities
  When I launch a "curl" attack with:
    """
    ../../test/respurces/checks/ssl/ssl-vulns.sh <hostname>
    """
  Then the output should contain:
    """
    1\n
    """

  Scenario: Check for soon to expire ssl certs
    When I launch a "curl" attack with:
    """
    ../../test/respurces/checks/ssl/ssl-cert.sh <hostname>
    """
    Then the output should contain:
    """
